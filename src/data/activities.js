The place itself is only a counter (almost all ramen shops are) where you order classic ramen bowls from a ticketing machine in front and then basically surround the cooks. The broth here is light, but the grilled char-siu (pork) provides just enough substance and smokiness. Afuri is also in a cool neighborhood and is ideal for an on-the-go ramen stop when you still want to be able to move after you eat. Also, hangovers - its good for those.",
